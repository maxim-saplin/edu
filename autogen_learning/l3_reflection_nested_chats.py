## Notes
# Overal with nested chats we get a top level chat with 2 turns between Critic and writer (4 messages),
# Before initiating the 2nd turn the Critic staets 4 child chats aggregating feedback from 4 different agents
# and then using it as the 2nd message to the writer asking it to make another attempt
# This looks like an interesting pattern where you can launch a subchain of prompts doing processing of master chain's mssages,
# also aggergsting a review from 4 agents from a nested chat makes sense as it may save on tokens
# and not confuse the writer with abundance of input words.
# Yet the demonstration is quite rigid prompt chain, not a versatile self-managed collective of agents (yet again inflated Gen AI expectations).
# Anyways not sure if Autogen brings much vaoue here, still missing the control over prompts and their flow (the LangChain controversy is relevant here),
# Autogen might be giving to much abstractions which stay in a way and do not help with debugging (see the llm summarization commented out
# in nested chats due to bugs). I still fell that for such cases (up until lesson 3) Autogen doesn't give much values,
# simplictic prompt chains bakcreferencing previous chains with minimal LLM libraries are better and give more visibility and controler over prompts,
# e.g. https://gist.github.com/disler/d51d7e37c3e5f8d277d8e0a71f4a1d2e
# (TODO - try recreating this sample with prompt chain as in the link, see how it compares)
