1. Activate venv
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Notes

- Tried Marimo (`marimo edit --watch 1_smolagents.py` ) with 1st lesson, unfortunate discoveries:
    - No debegging (breakpoints, traces, stepping into)
    - No clear way to store cell outputs to Git - found that Marimo uses a different approach - Auto-download (availble thropugh gerar icon at the top right). This way a snapshot will be saved to `__marimo__` folder
