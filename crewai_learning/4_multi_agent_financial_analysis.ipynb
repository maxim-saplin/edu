    "Maxim's remarks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior to running the code... Fake agents pretending to be smth they are not, to do, what they are not equiped to do. I.e.\"Data Analyst\" supposedly \"uses statistical modeling and machine learning to provide crucial insights.\". While this agent wan't be crunching any numbers, gathering datasets or fitting any models into the data I have no doubts the agent will generate some output which pretends to be the result of deep ML analysis of some data\n",
    "- Thoughout the course I had this suspicion which I can now formulate. Agent descriptions and taks seemed redundant, i.e. the role description almost always is primed for a one single task that follows latter, not a single cases showed that an agent could be assignde multiple tasks. In the persepctive when every agent has one purpuse which is essentially it's task there's no point in a separate task\n",
    "- 10 minutes and 315592 tokens latter (~$2) the GPT-4o agents have produced very shallow recoemndations which can be applied to any company, no need to run agents...\n",
    "- It is clear that the study materials are not supposed to be production ready, complex and big but ratehr small and isolated to demonstrate the point... Yet it is also clear that the state of agentic development allows only narow application, we are not talking of any generic applicaitons to broader scope of tasks. What we see is a the ability to build a fragile chain of text generators, for some cases make a next level of automation possible"

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs in Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia,\" which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure excludes the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison and the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n",

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs in Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia,\" which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure excludes the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison and the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n",
      "Forward-Looking Statements\n",
      "This press release includes estimates and statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.

Those future events and trends may relate to, among other things, developments relating to the war in Ukraine and escalation of the war in the surrounding region, political and civil unrest or military action in the geographies where we conduct business and operate, difficult conditions in global capital markets, foreign exchange markets and the broader economy, and the effect that these events may have on our revenues, operations, access to capital, and profitability. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the risk factors discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the factors discussed in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, particularly under the headings \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Risk Factors\" and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs in Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia,\" which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure excludes the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison and the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n",
      "Forward-Looking Statements\n",
      "This press release includes estimates and statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.

Those future events and trends may relate to, among other things, developments relating to the war in Ukraine and escalation of the war in the surrounding region, political and civil unrest or military action in the geographies where we conduct business and operate, difficult conditions in global capital markets, foreign exchange markets and the broader economy, and the effect that these events may have on our revenues, operations, access to capital, and profitability. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the risk factors discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the factors discussed in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, particularly under the headings \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Risk Factors\" and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      "Investors in EPAM Systems, Inc. EPAM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $110.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n",
      "What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for EPAM Systems shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, EPAM Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computers - IT Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.43 per share to $2.40 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about EPAM Systems right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.Click to see the trades now >>\n",

      "\n",
      "### Financial Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Revenue Decline**: EPAM's Q3 2023 revenue was $1.152 billion, down 6.1% year-over-year. The annual revenue for 2023 also saw a decline due to volatile market conditions and demand fluctuations. This indicates a potential risk of continued revenue decline if market conditions do not improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cost Optimization Program**: EPAM has initiated a Cost Optimization Program expected to deliver over $100 million in annualized savings. While this program aims to improve financial efficiency, there are associated risks such as potential disruptions in operations and employee morale due to cost-cutting measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **GAAP Income Reduction**: EPAM's GAAP income has also declined. For example, in Q4 2023, the income was $10.59, reflecting a 2.8% decrease over the fiscal year. This reduction in income could impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives and technology advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Operational Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implementation of Cost Optimization Program**: The ongoing Cost Optimization Program involves significant changes in operational processes. This can lead to temporary disruptions and inefficiencies as the company adapts to new cost structures. Additionally, there may be risks related to workforce reduction, which could affect project delivery and client satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Geopolitical Risks**: EPAM operates in multiple countries, including regions with geopolitical tensions. These geopolitical risks can lead to operational disruptions, increased costs, and challenges in managing a global workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technology and Innovation**: EPAM's reliance on continuous technological innovation poses an operational risk. Failure to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements could result in loss of competitive edge and market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Market Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High Implied Volatility**: The high implied volatility in EPAM's stock options indicates that the market expects significant price fluctuations in the future. This volatility can be attributed to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, changes in client spending, and competitive pressures. High volatility can lead to unpredictable stock performance, impacting investor confidence and market valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Competitive Landscape**: EPAM operates in a highly competitive market with other major players in the software engineering and consulting space. Market risks include losing clients to competitors, pricing pressures, and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Economic Environment**: The broader economic environment also poses a market risk. Economic slowdowns, changes in regulatory policies, and fluctuations in demand for digital transformation services can impact EPAM's market performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Safeguards and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diversification**: EPAM should continue to diversify its service offerings and client base to mitigate the risks associated with revenue decline and market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement robust financial and operational monitoring systems to track the effectiveness of the Cost Optimization Program and make adjustments as needed to minimize disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Employee Engagement**: Focus on maintaining high employee engagement and morale during the implementation of cost-saving measures to ensure that productivity and client satisfaction are not adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management Framework**: Develop a comprehensive risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate geopolitical, operational, and market risks. This should include scenario planning and contingency strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Innovation and Investment**: Continue to invest in research and development to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and maintain a competitive edge in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully analyzing and addressing these risks, EPAM can better align its trading activities with the firm's risk tolerance and trading preferences, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: \n",
      "EPAM faces several financial, operational, and market risks, including revenue decline, implementation challenges with its Cost Optimization Program, high implied volatility in stock options, and a competitive landscape. To mitigate these risks, EPAM should diversify its service offerings, continuously monitor financial and operational metrics, engage employees effectively during cost-saving initiatives, develop a comprehensive risk management framework, and invest in innovation. These measures will help align trading activities with the firm's risk tolerance and trading preferences, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.\u001b[0m\n",

The ongoing Cost Optimization Program indicates efforts to mitigate these impacts, but may also signal underlying operational challenges.\\n  - Implied volatility in EPAM's stock options suggests potential major market movements.

Risk Assessment from Risk Advisor\\n- **Financial Risks**:\\n  - The high implied volatility in stock options suggests potential significant price movements, which could impact investor sentiment and market value.\\n  - The Cost Optimization Program, while aiming to save over $100 million annually, introduces risks related to operational efficiency and employee morale, which could affect productivity and service delivery.\\n- **Operational Risks**:\\n  - The decrease in revenue and income from operations may indicate operational inefficiencies or market challenges that need to be addressed to maintain competitiveness.\\n  - The ongoing geopolitical instability, particularly related to the war in Ukraine, poses risks to EPAM's operations and employee safety, potentially impacting service continuity and client engagements.\\n- **Market Risks**:\\n  - The recognition as a top IT sourcing vendor in the UK is a positive signal; however, maintaining this position requires continuous innovation and competitive pricing strategies to fend off competitors.\\n  - The anticipated major market movements, as suggested by the high implied volatility in stock options, could lead to unpredictable market conditions, affecting strategic planning and financial forecasting.\\n### Conclusion\\nEPAM Systems, Inc. faces both significant market opportunities and potential threats.

      "In the complex and often unpredictable realm of financial markets, a strategic approach is essential for success. Akin to a chess grandmaster who meticulously plans multiple moves ahead, a successful day trader relies on an extensively developed trading strategy. This strategy provides critical guidance across numerous daily choices — from selecting which securities to engage with to identifying prime moments and chart patterns for market entry and exit points.\n",
      "Related reading: Popular Day Trading Strategies Backtested\n",
      "A robust day trading strategy goes beyond mere profit-seeking. It incorporates stringent risk management protocols. The volatile nature of financial markets carries inherent risks that can escalate quickly, potentially leading traders toward significant losses or even complete monetary collapse without careful planning. By establishing explicit rules around engagement in trades—and emphasizing the use of disposable risk capital only—a well-constructed trading plan acts as a bulwark against rash decisions driven by emotion or hasty judgment calls.\n",
      "Having said this, possession of such strategies alone does not guarantee success. Adherence is key. For one to become an accomplished day trader requires steadfast discipline in faithfully executing their chosen strategy amidst tumultuous market swings where emotional tensions may surge. It takes considerable emotional intelligence: controlling emotions while under duress, remaining calm during turbulent times, and consistently making measured decisions are what differentiate between merely holding onto a blueprint for victory in day trading versus actualizing it through disciplined action.\n",
      "Day Trading Strategies\n",
      "Before exploring different day trading strategies in detail, it’s important to define what a trading strategy entails. Essentially, a trading strategy is a set of rules or guidelines that a trader follows to make trading decisions. These rules can be based on various factors, such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or market sentiment, and they dictate when to enter and exit a trade, how much to risk on each trade, and how to manage open positions.\n",
      "Let’s now examine several popular day trading strategies, including trading strategies for beginners, and their use in enhancing trading results.\n",
      "1. Momentum Trading\n",
      "At the heart of momentum trading is the practice of following trends. Those employing this method aim to profit from the movement of a stock or other financial instrument by purchasing during an uptrend and offloading it when there’s a downtrend. This approach depends substantially on technical analysis, as traders deploy numerous indicators to spot trends and predict shifts in momentum.\n",
      "Key indicators utilized are:\n",
      "The Momentum Indicator\n",
      "Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
      "Moving Averages\n",
      "Stochastic Oscillator\n",
      "Together, these tools offer critical information about both the vigor and trajectory of market momentum.\n",
      "2. Breakout Trading\n",
      "In Breakout trading, traders initiate a position when a security’s price crosses above resistance or drops below support levels, indicating the onset of a strong trend. The key to this strategy is identifying these support and resistance levels and waiting for confirmation of a breakout, which is often accompanied by increased volume.\n",
      "Once a breakout is confirmed, traders set their price targets and stop-loss orders, with the former based on recent price swings or the size of the price pattern, and the latter based on the old support or resistance level that should now act as the new resistance or support.\n",
      "3. Range Trading\n",
      "Range trading is a strategy applied when a security consistently trades within a specific price range over a given period. The top of this range typically provides resistance, while the bottom offers support. Traders using this strategy aim to buy at the support level and sell at the resistance level, capitalizing on the price fluctuations within the range.\n",
      "To identify when to enter and exit a trade, traders often use technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillator, and the commodity channel index (CCI).\n",
      "4. Reversal Trading\n",
      "Trading based on reversal strategies focuses on exploiting changes in the direction of a stock’s price movement. Those who use this approach search for important backtested trading indicators that suggest an impending trend reversal, including diminishing momentum, variations in trading volume, and patterns like forming lower highs or higher lows.\n",
      "The market cycle framework proposed by Richard Wyckoff is pivotal to the practice of reverse trading. According to Wyckoff’s theory, markets experience four distinct phases:\n",
      "Accumulation\n",
      "Markup\n",
      "Distribution\n",
      "Markdown\n",
      "By leveraging this cyclical understanding put forth by Wyckoff’s theory, traders are better positioned to predict and profit from potential trend reversals.\n",
      "5. Gap Trading\n",
      "Gap trading capitalizes on the price discontinuities that occur between a security’s closing price one day and its opening price on the subsequent day. These pricing gaps may result from various catalysts, including earnings reports, alterations in analyst recommendations, or major news developments. They present opportunities for traders adept at recognizing these gaps and forecasting the ensuing direction of stock movement. When integrated with additional tools and indicators of technical analysis, this strategy can prove particularly potent in identifying trading prospects.\n",
      "6. Trend Following\n",
      "The strategy of trend following is centered on acquiring securities when their prices are climbing and offloading them when the prices decline. This approach operates under the principle that security prices are regulated. Move in discernible trends, which, if correctly identified by traders, can be exploited for monetary gain. Trend following strategies cater to various trading durations, from short-term to long-term endeavors, and are applicable across any type of security demonstrating trending price behavior.\n",
      "Traders implement tools associated with technical analysis like moving averages and trendlines in order to pinpoint these prevailing trends within the market.\n",
      "7. Mean Reversion\n",
      "The mean reversion strategy is predicated on the assumption that following a deviation, prices are inclined to return to their average or “mean” level. By capitalizing on these anticipated price corrections, traders who adopt this approach buy securities when they fall below their mean value and sell them as they bounce back to it.\n",
      "In practice, this method frequently complements technical analysis instruments like Bollinger Bands or RSI, which help pinpoint conditions where securities are overbought or oversold.\n",
      "8. Scalping\n",
      "Scalping is a trading strategy characterized by high frequency, involving the completion of multiple small trades during the course of a trading day to capitalize on slight variations in price. The goal for scalpers is to seize minute price movements and expediently exit their positions to minimize risk exposure. This approach demands substantial discipline and the capacity for rapid decision-making since trade durations can range from mere seconds up to several minutes.\n",
      "In markets that are subject to frequent and notable fluctuations in prices, scalping has been shown to be particularly potent due to its effectiveness in such volatile environments.\n",
      "9. News Trading\n",
      "The trading strategy known as news trading focuses on executing trades based on the anticipation of news events that are expected to affect a security’s price. Traders who employ this approach seek to take advantage of the volatility in prices typically seen after significant news releases. This could encompass releases of economic data, earnings reports, or any other piece of news deemed likely to substantially influence the pricing of securities.\n",
      "Success in news trading demands swift analysis and rapid response to newly emerging information about events.\n",
      "10. Pattern Trading\n",
      "The pattern trading strategy focuses on detecting distinct configurations in the price graphs that suggest specific trade entry and exit points. Recognizable patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triangles, and flags are some of the formations traders seek out.\n",
      "These configurations are thought to be indicative of potential future price movements, which empower traders with insights for making well-informed decisions about their trades.\n",
      "Although this technique can stand alone as a methodical approach to trading, it is commonly combined with additional tools and methods from the realm of technical analysis to reinforce its effectiveness.\n",
      "11. Support and Resistance Trading\n",
      "Traders engaged in Support and Resistance trading discern critical price points at which a security’s value has historically changed direction. The ‘support’ level is identified as the price point at which sufficient buying momentum overpowers selling activity, driving the price upward. Conversely, the ‘resistance’ level is defined as the price point where intense selling momentum supersedes buyers’ interest, resulting in a downward movement of the price.\n",
      "These pivotal levels allow traders to strategically determine optimal moments for initiating or concluding trades by providing insights into potential trend reversals based on historical data.\n",
      "12. Fibonacci Trading\n",
      "The trading strategy based on Fibonacci involves using the sequence of numbers where each subsequent number is derived from adding the previous two. This approach helps traders identify probable support and resistance points within price charts. Adherents of this strategy anticipate that prices frequently retract by a specific portion of a prior trend—commonly 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%—before resuming their initial course.\n",
      "Employing these levels of retracement, traders are better equipped to determine optimal moments for entering and exiting positions in the market.\n",
      "13. Volume Spread Analysis (VSA)\n",
      "The Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) approach is centered on analyzing the relationship between trading volume, price range, and where the price closes. VSA posits that variations in both trade volume and price spread may offer hints regarding upcoming movements in prices.\n",
      "To illustrate, when there’s a surge in volume accompanied by a broadening of the spread, this might signal intense pressure to buy or sell. This could point towards an impending shift in trend direction.\n",
      "14. Event-Driven Trading\n",
      "An event-driven trading strategy is predicated on executing trades based on particular events or news that are anticipated to have an effect on a security’s price. Such events could encompass earnings reports, the release of economic data, or fluctuations in interest rates. The underlying concept of this strategy is that these occurrences can generate volatility in prices, which presents traders with chances for profitable transactions.\n",
      "Traders who wish to thrive using an event-driven approach must possess the capacity for swift analysis and response to newsworthy happenings.\n",
      "15. Arbitrage Trading\n",
      "The arbitrage trading strategy capitalizes on the differences in prices across various markets or securities. Take a stock as an example. If it’s available at a reduced rate on one exchange and at an elevated rate on another, traders have the opportunity to purchase from the less costly exchange and sell it where the price is higher, thereby securing the margin as their earnings.\n",
      "Discovering opportunities for arbitrage can be challenging since they tend to be ephemeral. When identified, these opportunities present a method of conducting trades that carry minimal risk while yielding profits.\n",
      "16. Statistical Arbitrage\n",
      "Statistical arbitrage represents a sophisticated form of trading that exploits price variations using complex mathematical algorithms. This method goes beyond basic buy-and-sell approaches, as it constructs portfolios by balancing long and short positions that are anticipated to eventually move towards each other in terms of value.\n",
      "This approach is intricate and requires extensive knowledge in both statistics and financial markets. It holds the promise of executing trades with minimal risk while maintaining the possibility for substantial profits.\n",
      "What is day trading?\n",
      "Day trading is a trading style characterized by:\n",
      "Buying and selling financial instruments, such as day trading stocks, within a single day to capitalize on minor price fluctuations, which is also known as day trade\n",
      "Closing out all positions before the market closes to avoid holding them overnight and being exposed to potential price gaps or news events that occur outside of trading hours\n",
      "Being applied to a variety of financial instruments, including stocks, forex, commodities, and futures.\n",
      "While day trading can prove profitable, it also presents its share of challenges. Given its fast-paced nature, day trading requires a significant amount of time and focus. Day traders need to:\n",
      "Keep a constant eye on the markets\n",
      "Make quick decisions and execute trades at a moment’s notice\n",
      "Be well-versed in technical analysis\n",
      "Have a solid understanding of the financial markets\n",
      "Despite these challenges, with the right approach and the right tools, day trading can be a rewarding and lucrative career.\n",
      "What are the advantages of day trading?\n",
      "Day trading offers significant advantages, making it an attractive career choice for many. It provides individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and work independently without reporting to a boss or manager, which is highly valued by those who prioritize flexibility and self-direction in their professional lives. There is an abundance of freely available information and resources both online and in libraries that support aspiring day traders on their journey into this accessible profession.\n",
      "Related reading: Candlesticks Patterns\n",
      "The potential for substantial profits stands out as another major benefit of day trading. Due to the nature of executing short-term trades, day traders have the ability to capitalize on minor price fluctuations that may go unnoticed by long-term investors. They mitigate risks linked with overnight position holding—such as unexpected news events or economic shifts causing drastic price changes—by liquidating positions before the close of each trading session. This strategy can offer a sense of security and comfort not commonly found in longer-duration investments.\n",
      "Nevertheless, one must carefully consider the inherent risks when contemplating day trading as these perils are considerable despite its benefits—and rapid profits come hand-in-hand with possibilities for steep losses too. To achieve success in this field requires an extensive knowledge base about market dynamics along with implementing a robust risk management process within your comprehensive trading strategy meticulously developed over time. With commitment toward skill development required for navigating these markets effectively. Pursuing a career in successful day trading can be immensely satisfying as well as financially rewarding.\n",
      "How do I start day trading?\n",
      "Embarking on a day trading career requires not only an understanding of the stock market, but also skills and thorough preparation. It’s essential to grasp how stocks are priced, interpret charts, and apply fundamental analysis before you begin, creating a robust framework for informed decisions when trading. One needs to set up a trading account through a reputable broker. Several online brokers offer platforms tailored specifically for day traders that supply real-time market data and sophisticated tools necessary for prompt trade execution.\n",
      "Once you’ve acquired sufficient knowledge about the markets and opened your trading account, the next critical step is developing your own unique trading strategy. A good strategy acts as your guidepost—detailing which positions to take or leave behind based on certain criteria such as entry/exit timing, capital risked per transaction, and selection of securities aligned with individual financial aims plus risk tolerance levels. Validate its reliability by testing it against historical data before applying it in live trades.\n",
      "For those aiming at becoming successful day traders, they should adopt effective risk management tactics.\n",
      "Employ stop-loss orders to cap potential losses\n",
      "Spread risks via diversification of trades\n",
      "Invest solely what can comfortably be lost without financial strain (risk capital)\n",
      "Maintain discipline avoiding emotionally-driven decisions\n",
      "Given that emotions can run high during active trade periods, leading sometimes astray from planned strategies.\n",
      "How to use technical analysis for day trading\n",
      "Day traders heavily rely on technical analysis as a key instrument. Unlike fundamental analysis, which looks at factors like a company’s earnings, dividends, and industry trends to value its stock, technical analysis focuses on price movements and patterns within the stock market. The principle behind technical analysis is that all known information is already reflected in a stock’s price, and therefore, analyzing its past price movements can provide clues to its future direction.\n",
      "Technical analysis involves the use of charts, trendlines, and technical indicators to analyze market patterns and predict future price movements. Moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands are among the most commonly used technical indicators in trading. These tools are used by traders to analyze price trends and potential market movements. These tools can help traders identify trends and make informed decisions about when to enter and exit trades.\n",
      "Remember, while technical analysis can be a powerful tool, it is not infallible, and its predictions do not always come to fruition. Therefore, it’s important to use it in conjunction with other tools and strategies, and always have a backup plan in case a trade doesn’t go as expected.\n",
      "How to use stop loss orders in day trading?\n",
      "Stop loss orders are integral risk management tools in the unpredictable realm of day trading. A stop loss order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a security when it reaches a certain price. This helps limit the trader’s loss on a security position. It’s essentially an automatic trigger to sell if the stock drops to a certain level, preventing further losses. This allows traders to control their maximum risk and protect their trading capital.\n",
      "Setting the correct stop loss value is crucial as too conservative a value may not leave room for normal market fluctuations and could lead to premature trade exits, while too liberal a value may expose the trader to excessive losses. Therefore, setting stop-loss orders requires careful consideration of the security’s price volatility, the trader’s risk tolerance, and their overall trading strategy. By effectively using stop-loss orders, traders can manage their risks, protect their profits, and navigate the markets with greater confidence.\n",
      "How to minimize risk in day trading?\n",
      "Minimizing risk holds utmost significance in day trading. One of the key ways to minimize risk is by adopting a systematic approach to trading. This means:\n",
      "Having a clear trading plan that outlines your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and trading strategy\n",
      "Following this plan to guide all your trading activities\n",
      "Making disciplined, rational decisions rather than being swayed by emotions or market hype\n",
      "By following a systematic approach, you can reduce the risk associated with day trading and increase your chances of success.\n",
      "Another crucial risk management technique is position sizing, which involves determining the number of shares to trade based on your risk tolerance and account size. This ensures that you only risk a small portion of your trading capital on each trade, thus limiting potential losses. For example, following the one percent rule, which suggests that no more than 1% of a trader’s capital should be risked on a single trade, can help manage and reduce risk.\n",
      "Practicing diversification is also a key risk management strategy. By diversifying your trades across different industries, sectors, and geographic regions, you can spread out your risk and increase your potential opportunities. Remember, successful day trading is not just about making profits; it’s also about effectively managing risks. By employing these risk management techniques, you can protect your capital, limit your losses, and increase your chances of success in the volatile world of day trading.\n",
      "Is day trading legal?\n",
      "Day trading is completely legitimate in most nations, including the United States, but it comes with specific regulatory requirements, particularly for individuals classified as pattern day traders. The U.S.-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) categorizes a trader as a pattern day trader if they make four or more day trades within a rolling five-business-day period and these trades represent over 6% of their total trading activity in their margin account during that time.\n",
      "Those who qualify as pattern day traders must ensure that they have at least $25,000 equity in their margin accounts on any days when they are actively participating in day trading. Such regulations exist to enable brokerage firms to cover potential shortfalls stemming from an investor’s activities related to day trading.\n",
      "How many percent make money day trading?\n",
      "In reality, a significant portion of day traders incur losses, with estimates indicating only about 1% to 10% of day traders consistently make profits. The fact is, day trading is difficult and requires a combination of:\n",
      "knowledge\n",
      "skills\n",
      "discipline\n",
      "the ability to manage risk effectively\n",
      "Without these, traders are likely to lose money and incur losses.\n",
      "However, this doesn’t mean that making money from day trading is impossible. Traders with strong past performance have been shown to earn strong returns in the future, indicating that consistent profitability is possible, though rare. Also, the profitability of day trading depends significantly on the trader’s skill, strategy, and the amount of capital they have for trading. Therefore, while day trading can be risky and challenging, with the right approach and a sound strategy, it can be a profitable venture.\n",
      "Is day trading gambling?\n",
      "On the surface, day trading and gambling might appear alike since both entail financial risks in pursuit of profits. However, there are crucial distinctions between the two. Unlike gambling, which is primarily based on luck, day trading requires:\n",
      "A thorough understanding of the financial markets\n",
      "The ability to analyze market trends and indicators\n",
      "The use of strategic planning to make informed trading decisions\n",
      "That said, day trading can become akin to gambling when traders engage in it without a proper understanding of the markets or a solid trading strategy. This can lead to trades being placed based on uncertainty and misinformation, rather than informed decisions. Furthermore, trading for the thrill or out of desperation to recover losses can also turn day trading into a form of gambling.\n",
      "Hence, while day trading is not intrinsically gambling, lack of adequate knowledge, strategy, and emotional control can turn it into one.\n",
      "What are some important Day trading rules?\n",
      "Like any investment form, day trading functions according to a set of rules that can steer traders towards success. One of the most important rules is to have a clear understanding of the markets. This includes understanding basic trading procedures, tools, and information about the stocks being traded. Knowledge is power in trading, and the more you know, the better equipped you will be to make informed trading decisions.\n",
      "Another critical rule in day trading is to be realistic about profits. The market is unpredictable, and there’s no guarantee of making a profit on every trade. Sometimes, settling for smaller gains can be more beneficial than chasing larger, riskier profits. It’s also important to avoid overtrading, which can lead to increased commission costs and reduced ability to focus on high-quality trades.\n",
      "To be successful in day trading, remember:\n",
      "Be realistic about profits\n",
      "Settle for smaller gains when necessary\n",
      "Avoid overtrading\n",
      "Focus on a few high-quality trades\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can increase your chances of success in day trading.\n",
      "Most importantly, day trading requires discipline. This includes sticking to your trading plan, not letting emotions dictate your trading decisions, and learning from your mistakes. By keeping a trading journal, you can track your trades, identify patterns, and improve your trading strategies over time. Remember, successful day trading is not about making a quick buck; it’s about consistent, disciplined trading over the long term.\n",
      "How do you calculate position size?\n",
      "In day trading, position sizing entails deciding the number of shares to trade, factoring in your risk tolerance and account size. This helps ensure that you only risk a small portion of your trading capital on each trade, thus limiting potential losses. For example, following the one percent rule, which suggests that no more than 1% of a trader’s capital should be risked on a single trade, can help manage and reduce risk.\n",
      "There are various methods for calculating position size in day trading. Some common methods include:\n",
      "Risking a maximum of 1% to 3% per trade for small accounts\n",
      "Employing a fixed-dollar stop to determine position size for larger accounts, allowing for risk control without always risking a full 1% of the account\n",
      "Using a measure of volatility, such as the Average True Range (ATR), to adjust position sizes according to market conditions\n",
      "Using the historical maximum drawdown of a trading strategy to determine how many contracts or shares to trade\n",
      "These methods can help traders effectively manage their risk and position size in day trading.\n",
      "What are some important Risk Management Techniques for Day Traders\n",
      "In the realm of day trading, risk management plays an integral role. One of the key day trading risk management techniques is to always plan your trades in advance. This includes setting specific prices for entry and exit, which helps in managing risk and maximizing returns. Another important technique is to use stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order is a trade order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price, thus limiting the potential loss on a trade.\n",
      "Position sizing is another crucial risk management technique. This involves determining the number of shares to trade based on your risk tolerance and account size. This ensures that you only risk a small portion of your trading capital on each trade, thus limiting potential losses. For example, following the one percent rule, which suggests that no more than 1% of a trader’s capital should be risked on a single trade, can help manage and reduce risk.\n",
      "Lastly, diversification can also help in managing risk. By diversifying your trades across different industries, sectors, and geographic regions, you can spread out your risk and increase your potential opportunities. Remember, successful day trading is not just about making profits; it’s also about effectively managing risks. By employing these risk management techniques, you can protect your capital, limit your losses, and increase your chances of success in the volatile world of day trading.\n",
      "What are the pros and cons of day trading?\n",
      "Like any method of investing, day trading has its own set of pros and cons. On the positive side, it holds the promise for rapid earnings as trades are conducted on a short-term basis. Traders have the flexibility to dictate their schedules and work autonomously without reporting to a superior. Day trading offers the chance for quick capital turnover and possibly smaller losses compared to long-term investments, which could lead to higher profits.\n",
      "There are several disadvantages associated with day trading.\n",
      "It does not assure wealth.\n",
      "There is a high risk of substantial financial losses for those lacking a strategic approach.\n",
      "Various costs such as commission fees and slippage may diminish profit margins.\n",
      "Traders frequently achieve results that fall short when measured against overall market performance due in part to inconsistent application of methods or lackluster dedication towards engaging with trading activities.\n",
      "It should also be recognized that mastering day trading requires considerable time commitment and effort. Achieving success in this field requires:\n",
      "The ability swiftly make decisions and execute transactions immediately\n",
      "Regularly staying informed about current events affecting markets\n",
      "Careful scrutiny of market trends\n",
      "A continual process of learning along with an adjustment period accommodating new techniques amidst changing market dynamics\n",
      "In spite of all these challenges, if one commits fully both in terms of energy & time investment, Day Trading might just prove itself an enriching career path offering substantive monetary rewards.\n",
      "What is leverage in day trading?\n",
      "Leverage in day trading is essentially the employment of borrowed capital to enhance a trader’s market exposure beyond what they could achieve using their own funds. Leverage enables traders to increase their investment capacity, thereby potentially boosting profits from trades. For instance, with $1,000 in an account and applying a 10:1 leverage ratio, a trader would be able to take on positions worth up to $10,000.\n",
      "The flip side of leveraging is that while it has the power to magnify gains substantially. Losses too can escalate equally quickly. Should a position move unfavorably against them, traders may find themselves facing deficits exceeding their initial stake—a scenario necessitating not only deep market knowledge but also robust risk management practices and disciplined execution of trades in order to avoid severe fiscal damage.\n",
      "Incorporation of leverage into one’s day trading strategy is widespread among brokers who frequently extend significant levels of borrowing power, especially toward experienced traders. Nevertheless—it bears emphasis—the imperative lies squarely on traders’ shoulders both for appreciating risks associated with leveraged positions and ensuring its judicious application within their financial pursuits.\n",
      "How do you handle emotions while trading?\n",
      "Emotions can profoundly influence trading, frequently leading traders into impulsive decisions that may lead to expensive errors. Therefore, managing emotions is a crucial aspect of successful trading. One technique for managing emotions is defusion, which involves distancing oneself from their thoughts and feelings, rather than allowing them to dominate one’s perspective. This can help traders make more rational decisions, rather than being swayed by their emotions.\n",
      "Another technique for managing emotions is mindfulness, which involves bringing one’s attention to the present moment and observing one’s thoughts and feelings without judgment. This can help traders become more aware of their emotional reactions to market events and make more deliberate, thoughtful responses. Writing down feelings can also help traders identify emotional patterns and their triggers, which can provide insights into how emotions impact their trading decisions.\n",
      "Maintaining discipline is also crucial for managing emotions in trading. This involves sticking to a trading plan and not letting emotions dictate trading decisions. By developing discipline, traders can maintain control over their trading activities, stay focused on their strategic goals, and avoid making impulsive decisions based on fleeting emotions.\n",
      "So, while emotions are a natural part of trading, learning to manage them effectively can be a key factor in trading success.\n",
      "What you should know about trading order and day trading strategies?\n",
      "Comprehending various types of trading orders is vital for day trading. The most common types of orders are:\n",
      "Market orders: intended for immediate execution at the current best available price\n",
      "Limit orders: allow traders to specify a maximum purchase price or minimum sale price\n",
      "Stop orders, or stop-loss orders: become market orders once a stock reaches a specified stop price\n",
      "These different order types can significantly affect the outcomes of trades and are important tools within day trading strategies.\n",
      "A successful day trader must also have a clear trading strategy. This is a set of rules that guide your trading decisions, dictating when to enter and exit trades, how much to risk on each trade, and which securities to trade. Your trading strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and trading style. It’s also important to backtest your strategy using historical data to ensure its effectiveness before using it with real money.\n",
      "What are the best times to trade during the day?\n",
      "The timing of your trades can greatly influence your trading success. Typically, the best times to trade are during the first hour and last hour of the trading day. These periods often see the most activity, with higher volumes and greater price movements. In particular, the first 15 minutes after the market opens can provide some of the biggest trades of the day based on initial trends. However, this period can also be volatile and risky, which is why some traders wait for a few minutes to an hour after the market opens before they start trading.\n",
      "While the morning session can be a prime time for trading due to its high volume and liquidity, the evening session can also be volatile as traders adjust or close their positions for the day. However, the market often slows down after 11:00 a.m. ET, especially around lunchtime, making it more challenging to find good trade setups. Therefore, many professional day traders may stop trading around 11:30 a.m. ET when the volatility and volume tend to decrease.\n",
      "How important are psychology in day trading?\n",
      "Psychology holds a pivotal role in day trading. Traders’ perceptions and emotional responses can significantly influence their trading decisions and performance. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and loss aversion, can lead to irrational judgments and flawed reasoning. Similarly, emotional biases, like overconfidence and fear of missing out, can cause traders to make decisions based on emotions rather than rational analysis. Therefore, understanding and managing these psychological factors is essential for successful trading.\n",
      "There are several strategies that traders can use to manage their emotions and enhance their psychological resilience. These include practicing mindfulness, which can increase awareness and create a space between emotions and reactions, allowing for more deliberate responses to trading situations. Labeling thoughts and emotions as they arise can also help in distancing oneself from these feelings and not allowing them to dominate one’s perspective. By effectively managing their emotions, traders can improve their decision-making abilities, increase their trading performance, and achieve greater success in the markets.\n",
      "What are some important Tools for Day Trading?\n",
      "Success in day trading requires more than a robust strategy and a thorough understanding of the markets. You also need the right tools. One of the most essential tools for day trading is an online broker. A good broker provides services such as direct access routing and fast executions, which are critical for executing trades quickly and at favorable prices.\n",
      "Another essential tool for day traders is stock scanning software. This tool helps traders find stocks to trade based on predefined searches for movers, volume spikes, and biggest gainers/losers. Charting software, on the other hand, is necessary for visualizing price action and conducting technical analysis. Many online brokers offer advanced charting tools that allow traders to analyze price trends and identify potential trading opportunities.\n",
      "There are also other tools that can enhance your trading efficiency and success. These include:\n",
      "Real-time news services, which provide up-to-the-minute news and market updates\n",
      "Mobile trading apps, which allow you to monitor the markets and manage your trades on the go\n",
      "Automated trading resources\n",
      "Real-time data and alerts\n",
      "These tools can be invaluable for day traders, helping them make timely and informed trading decisions.\n",
      "Can you start with a Demo Account with your day trading strategies?\n",
      "Yes, initiating with a demo account is an excellent approach to practice your day trading strategies without risking actual money. A demo account allows you to:\n",
      "Trade with virtual money in a simulated market environment\n",
      "Provide a valuable learning experience\n",
      "Familiarize yourself with trading software\n",
      "Understand how the market operates\n",
      "Test your trading strategies in a risk-free environment\n",
      "While demo trading can be a useful learning tool, it’s important to remember that simulated trading results may not always accurately reflect what you would achieve in a live trading environment. For instance, demo accounts often fill market orders at the price shown on the screen, which may not account for slippage that occurs in live trading. Furthermore, real emotions such as fear, hope, and greed are not present when trading with a demo account, and these emotions can significantly impact trading behavior when trading with real capital. Therefore, while demo trading can provide valuable insights and practice, it’s important to approach it as a learning tool rather than a predictor of future success.\n",
      "How to develop a trading plan for your day trading?\n",
      "Formulating a trading plan is a critical step towards becoming a successful day trader. A trading plan is a comprehensive document that outlines your trading goals, risk tolerance, and specific trading strategies. It serves as a roadmap for your trading activities, guiding you on when to enter and exit trades, how much to risk on each trade, and how to manage your open positions.\n",
      "Your trading plan should be tailored to your individual trading style, financial goals, and risk tolerance. It should include the following:\n",
      "Clearly defined entry and exit strategies, including specific criteria for entering and exiting trades\n",
      "Position sizing strategy and risk management principles\n",
      "Types of securities you will trade\n",
      "Timeframes you will trade on\n",
      "Technical indicators you will use\n",
      "Once you have a trading plan in place, it’s important to stick to it and avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotions or market hype. Your trading plan is your roadmap to success, and deviating from it can lead to costly mistakes. However, this doesn’t mean your trading plan should be set in stone. As you gain more experience and knowledge, you should continuously review and refine your trading plan to ensure it remains relevant and effective.\n",
      "What's the difference between day trading and forex trading?\n",
      "Day trading and forex trading are distinct approaches, each suitable for various trader types. The essence of day trading is the acquisition and sale of financial instruments within a single trading day to capitalize on minor price fluctuations. Day traders aim to liquidate all positions by the end of the market session, thereby sidestepping risks associated with overnight holding such as unexpected price gaps or after-hours news events. A diverse array of financial instruments—ranging from stocks and forex to commodities and futures—is amenable to this form of short-term speculation.\n",
      "In contrast, forex trading exclusively pertains to exchanging currency pairs in the foreign exchange marketplace. Given its higher liquidity compared with stock exchanges, this characteristic favors day traders who prioritize swift transitions into and out of their trades. Unlike stock markets limited by specific operational hours tied to an exchange’s location, forex offers round-the-clock accessibility reflecting its international scope.\n",
      "It’s crucial for traders considering these options not only grasp their similarities but also recognize essential distinctions.\n",
      "Forex focuses on currency pair exchanges whereas day trading can involve stocks or other assets.\n",
      "As opposed completely unbound 24-hour access afforded by globalized nature some key differences include that .\n",
      "Liquidity levels tend be favorably greater allowing easier quick transactions particularly applicable when dealing currencies versus other asset classes.\n",
      "Lastly factors influencing investments. While economic developments worldwide have significant effects, local company details might more directly impact equities speculations performed within a standard working timeframe respective zones which they operate under during defined periods.\n",
      "What's the difference between day trading and swing trading?\n",
      "Day trading and swing trading are two distinct trading styles, commonly employed by short-term traders. Day trading, as its name suggests, involves making trades that are opened and closed within the same trading day. Day traders aim to capitalize on short-term price movements and typically do not hold positions overnight. This style of trading requires a high level of focus and discipline, as it involves making quick decisions and executing trades at a moment’s notice.\n",
      "Swing trading, on the other hand, involves holding positions for several days to weeks in an attempt to capture short- to medium-term market trends. Unlike day traders, swing traders are not concerned with intra-day price fluctuations and instead focus on the overall direction of the price trend. This style of trading requires a good understanding of technical analysis and market trends, as well as a higher level of patience and discipline compared to day trading.\n",
      "What are the day trading pattern rule?\n",
      "In the realm of day trading, a regulation called the Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule exists. This rule, enforced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), applies to traders who execute four or more day trades within five business days, provided these trades account for more than 6% of the trader’s total trades in their margin account for the same period. Once designated as a PDT, traders are required to maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in their margin accounts on any day they engage in day trading.\n",
      "The PDT rule is in place to provide a cushion for brokerage firms to meet any deficiencies in the trader’s account resulting from day trading. It limits traders to four times their day-trading buying power, whereas non-PDT traders are limited to twice the amount of their excess equity. If a PDT receives a margin call, they have five business days to meet it, or their trading ability will be limited to twice the maintenance margin excess until the call is met.\n",
      "While the PDT rule might seem restrictive, it is important to understand and comply with it to avoid any potential penalties or trading restrictions.\n",
      "What are the common mistakes to avoid in day trading?\n",
      "Day trading is a demanding undertaking that necessitates a blend of knowledge, skill, and discipline. However, even the most seasoned traders can make mistakes. One of the most common mistakes is holding on to losses too long in the hope they will turn into profits. This is often a result of emotional decision-making and can lead to significant losses. Day traders should always have a predetermined exit strategy and stick to it, regardless of how the market moves.\n",
      "Another common mistake is entering day trading with unrealistic expectations. Many novice traders are lured into day trading by the prospect of quick riches. However, day trading is not a get-rich quick scheme; it requires time, effort, and a lot of patience. It’s important to set realistic expectations and understand that it will take time to become profitable.\n",
      "Lastly, many day traders make the mistake of not investing in adequate trading tools or technology. In the fast-paced world of day trading, having the right tools can be the difference between success and failure. This includes a reliable trading platform, real-time market data, and advanced charting tools. Without these, traders may find it difficult to make timely and well-informed trading decisions.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "Day trading is a fast-paced, dynamic form of trading that offers the potential for quick profits. However, it’s not without its challenges. To be successful in day trading, traders need a solid understanding of the markets, a well-thought-out trading strategy, and the ability to manage risk effectively. It also requires a high level of discipline and emotional control, as day trading can be a highly emotional endeavor.\n",
      "Throughout this guide, we’ve explored various day trading strategies, from momentum and breakout trading to scalping and arbitrage trading. We’ve also discussed the importance of having a trading plan, the role of psychology in trading, and the tools and resources that can aid in day trading. We’ve also highlighted the Pattern Day Trader rule and its implications for traders.\n",
      "Becoming a successful day trader is not easy. It requires time, effort, and a great deal of discipline. However, with the right approach, the right tools, and a sound strategy, it can be a rewarding and potentially lucrative career. Remember, the key to success in day trading lies not just in making profits, but also in effectively managing risks and learning from each trade, win or lose.\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions\n",
      "Can a day trader make 1% per day?\n",
      "No, it is not realistic for a day trader to consistently make 1% per day due to the compounded and variable nature of daily returns.\n",
      "How much money do day traders with $10000 accounts make per day on average?\n",
      "On average, day traders with $10,000 accounts can make $200-$600 per day, with skilled traders aiming for 2%-5% returns daily.\n",
      "So, it is possible to achieve a daily profit of $200 to $600 with a $10,000 account.\n",
      "What is the 11 am rule in trading?\n",
      "According to the 11 am rule of trading, there exists a 75% chance that a security on an upward trend will close within one percent of its highest point for the day if it achieves a new peak between 11:15 and 11:30 am Eastern Standard Time. This concept hinges on the assumption that should there be no market reversal by or before 11 am EST, then it is improbable for any substantial trend reversal to occur during the remainder of that particular trading day.\n",
      "Which strategy is best for day trading?\n",
      "In day trading, the most effective tactic is known as scalp trading. This strategy requires swift decision-making and promptly selling assets at the first sign of a price drop to curtail potential losses.\n",
      "What is the Pattern Day Trader rule?\n",
      "The Pattern Day Trader regulation mandates that traders who carry out four or more day trades within a span of five business days must uphold at least $25,000 in equity within their margin accounts on each day they participate in day trading activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Approaches:\n",
      "1. **Momentum Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Indicators**: Utilize Momentum Indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, and Stochastic Oscillator.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Breakout Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Identification**: Identify key support and resistance levels. Look for price crossing above resistance or below support.\n",
      "    - **Execution**: Enter the trade upon confirmation of the breakout, typically marked by increased volume. Set price targets based on recent price swings and stop-loss orders just beyond the breakout point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Range Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Indicators**: Use RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, and Commodity Channel Index (CCI).\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Gap Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Identification**: Look for gaps between the previous day's closing price and the current day's opening price due to news or significant events.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. **Scalping**:\n",

      "\n",
      "### Risk Management:\n",
      "1. **Stop-Loss Orders**: Set stop-loss levels to limit potential losses. The placement should be based on volatility and individual risk tolerance.\n",
      "2. **Position Sizing**: Follow the one percent rule—no more than 1% of trading capital should be risked on a single trade.\n",
      "3. **Diversification**: Spread trades across different strategies to mitigate risk.\n",
      "4. **Discipline**: Stick to the trading plan and avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotions.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Approaches:\n",
      "1. **Momentum Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Indicators**: Utilize Momentum Indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, and Stochastic Oscillator.\n",
      "    - **Strategy**: Trade in the direction of the current trend. Buy during uptrends and sell during downtrends. Use technical indicators to confirm the strength of the trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Breakout Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Identification**: Identify key support and resistance levels. Look for price crossing above resistance or below support.\n",
      "    - **Execution**: Enter the trade upon confirmation of the breakout, typically marked by increased volume. Set price targets based on recent price swings and stop-loss orders just beyond the breakout point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Range Trading**:\n",
      "    - **Indicators**: Use RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, and Commodity Channel Index (CCI).\n",
      "    - **Strategy**: Buy at the lower end (support) of the established range and sell at the upper end (resistance). This can be particularly useful if EPAM's stock shows stable trading within a specific range.\n",
      "\n",

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs incurred in connection with a restructuring program including the Company's exit from Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" and an \"organic constant currency basis,\" which are also non-GAAP financial measures. These measures exclude the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. In addition, revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" reflect the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n",

These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(b) Given the uncertainty in the region introduced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, EPAM has assigned delivery professionals in locations outside of the region to ensure the continuity of delivery for customers who have substantial delivery exposure to Ukraine or other delivery concerns resulting from the invasion. These employees are not billed to clients and operate largely in a standby or backup capacity. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(c) Discretionary compensation includes the reduction of previously accrued amounts associated with the Company's variable compensation program for the year ended December 31, 2021. This adjustment was made in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is not expected to recur in the future.\n",
      "(d) Cost Optimization Program charges includes severance and facilities charges incurred in connection with the program initiated in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",

These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(f) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia, the Company incurred impairment charges for long-lived assets in Russia including charges of $15.1 million associated with property and equipment, $3.8 million associated with right-of-use assets and $0.7 million associated with goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, impairment charges have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(g) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia and the process of completing a phased exit of its operations in Russia, the Company incurred charges associated with employee separation. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, employee separation costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(h) On July 26, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its remaining operations in Russia and recorded a loss on sale of approximately $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, including the recognition of the accumulated currency translation loss related to this foreign entity that was previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the financial statements. The Company excluded this loss from non-GAAP results as it is one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(i) One-time benefit related to the implementation of tax planning to disregard certain foreign subsidiaries as separate entities for U.S. income tax purposes. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, the benefit related to the implementation of tax planning has been excluded from non-GAAP results as it is one-time and unusual in nature.\n",

      "### Execution Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify Reversal Points:**\n",
      "   - **Technical Indicators:** Use RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
      "   - **Price Action:** Monitor candlestick patterns such as Doji, Hammer, and Engulfing patterns near support and resistance levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Entry Criteria:**\n",
      "   - **RSI Indicator:** Enter a long position when RSI is below 30 (indicating oversold) and shows a bullish crossover. Enter a short position when RSI is above 70 (indicating overbought) and shows a bearish crossover.\n",
      "   - **MACD Indicator:** Enter a long position when the MACD line crosses above the signal line from below. Enter a short position when the MACD line crosses below the signal line from above.\n",
      "   - **Candlestick Patterns:** Look for bullish reversal patterns near support levels for long positions and bearish reversal patterns near resistance levels for short positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Position Sizing:**\n",
      "   - **Risk Management:** Use a fixed percentage risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of the trading account). Calculate the position size based on the distance between entry point and stop-loss level.\n",
      "   - **Stop-Loss Placement:** Set stop-loss orders below recent swing lows for long positions and above recent swing highs for short positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Trade Management:**\n",
      "   - **Trailing Stop:** Use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor. Adjust the stop-loss level to just below recent swing lows (for long positions) or above recent swing highs (for short positions).\n",
      "   - **Profit Targets:** Set initial profit targets at key resistance levels for long positions and support levels for short positions. Consider partial profit-taking to secure gains while leaving a portion of the position to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Exit Criteria:**\n",
      "   - **Stop-Loss Trigger:** Exit the position if the stop-loss level is hit to minimize losses.\n",
      "   - **Reversal Signals:** Exit the position if technical indicators or price action signals a potential reversal against the trade direction.\n",
      "   - **Profit Target Achieved:** Exit the position when the price reaches the predefined profit target level.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "Given EPAM's current market conditions, including a recent decline in revenue and EPS, along with the stock's underperformance compared to the broader market, Reversal Trading is an appropriate strategy. This strategy helps capitalize on potential price reversals after periods of significant price movements, which aligns with EPAM's recent financial performance and market behavior.\n",

      "#### 1. Identify Reversal Points:\n",
      "   - **Technical Indicators:**\n",
      "     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions.\n",
      "     - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** Look for bullish and bearish crossovers.\n",
      "     - **Bollinger Bands:** Monitor price movement near the upper and lower bands for potential reversals.\n",
      "   - **Price Action:**\n",
      "     - **Candlestick Patterns:** Focus on reversal patterns such as Doji, Hammer, and Engulfing at support and resistance levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Entry Criteria:\n",
      "   - **RSI Indicator:**\n",
      "     - **Long Position:** Enter when RSI is below 30 (oversold) and shows a bullish crossover.\n",

      "     - Risk a fixed percentage per trade (e.g., 1-2% of the trading account).\n",
      "     - Calculate position size based on the distance between the entry point and stop-loss level.\n",
      "   - **Stop-Loss Placement:**\n",
      "     - **Long Position:** Below recent swing lows.\n",
      "     - **Short Position:** Above recent swing highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Trade Management:\n",
      "   - **Trailing Stop:**\n",
      "     - Adjust stop-loss to just below recent swing lows (for long positions) or above recent swing highs (for short positions) to lock in profits.\n",
      "   - **Profit Targets:**\n",
      "     - Set initial profit targets at key resistance levels (for long positions) and support levels (for short positions).\n",
      "     - Consider partial profit-taking to secure gains while allowing a portion of the position to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Exit Criteria:\n",
      "   - **Stop-Loss Trigger:** Exit if the stop-loss level is hit to minimize losses.\n",
      "   - **Reversal Signals:** Exit if technical indicators or price action signals a potential reversal against the trade direction.\n",
      "   - **Profit Target Achieved:** Exit when the price reaches the predefined profit target level.\n",
      "\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mBased on the information gathered from Yahoo Finance, here is a detailed execution plan for trading EPAM using the Reversal Trading strategy, considering the current market conditions and optimal pricing:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Plan for EPAM Using Reversal Trading Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Overview:\n",
      "EPAM Systems, Inc. (EPAM) is currently trading at $179.60 with a market capitalization of $10.412 billion. The stock has experienced a significant decline over the past year, with a YTD performance of -39.60% and a 1-year return of -18.05%. The recent price movements suggest potential opportunities for a reversal trading strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Current Market Conditions:\n",
      "- **Current Price**: $179.60\n",
      "- **52-Week Range**: $169.43 - $317.50\n",
      "- **Volume**: 67,039 (Average Volume: 715,529)\n",
      "- **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: 24.57\n",
      "- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: 7.31\n",
      "- **Market Cap**: $10.412B\n",
      "- **Beta (5Y Monthly)**: 1.42 (indicating moderate volatility)\n",
      "- **Profit Margin**: 9.28%\n",
      "- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: 8.47%\n",
      "- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: 13.05%\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Reversal Trading Strategy:\n",
      "1. **Identify Reversal Points**:\n",
      "   - **Support Level**: The 52-week low of $169.43 could act as a strong support level.\n",
      "   - **Resistance Level**: The recent high of $182.51 can be considered a short-term resistance level.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Entry Points**:\n",
      "   - **Long Position**: Enter a long position if the stock price approaches the support level of $169.43 and shows signs of reversal (e.g., bullish candlestick patterns like a hammer or bullish engulfing).\n",
      "   - **Short Position**: Enter a short position if the stock price nears the resistance level of $182.51 and shows signs of reversal (e.g., bearish candlestick patterns like a shooting star or bearish engulfing).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Confirmation Indicators**:\n",
      "   - **Volume**: Look for an increase in trading volume at the identified reversal points to confirm the strength of the reversal.\n",
      "   - **Technical Indicators**: Use Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. A crossover in Moving Averages (e.g., 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average) can also act as a confirmation signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management**:\n",
      "   - **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss order below the support level for long positions (e.g., $165) and above the resistance level for short positions (e.g., $185) to limit potential losses.\n",
      "   - **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your trading capital for each trade (e.g., 2%) to manage risk effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Profit Targets**:\n",
      "   - **Long Position**: Aim to take profits near the next resistance level (e.g., around $200) if the reversal from the support level is confirmed.\n",
      "   - **Short Position**: Aim to take profits near the next support level (e.g., around $160) if the reversal from the resistance level is confirmed.\n",
      "\n",

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs incurred in connection with a restructuring program including the Company's exit from Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" and an \"organic constant currency basis,\" which are also non-GAAP financial measures. These measures exclude the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. In addition, revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" reflect the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n",

      "This press release includes estimates and statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.

      "(a) Humanitarian support in Ukraine includes expenses related to EPAM's $100 million humanitarian commitment in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine to support EPAM professionals and their families in and displaced from Ukraine. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(b) Given the uncertainty in the region introduced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, EPAM has assigned delivery professionals in locations outside of the region to ensure the continuity of delivery for customers who have substantial delivery exposure to Ukraine or other delivery concerns resulting from the invasion. These employees are not billed to clients and operate largely in a standby or backup capacity. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(c) Discretionary compensation includes the reduction of previously accrued amounts associated with the Company's variable compensation program for the year ended December 31, 2021. This adjustment was made in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is not expected to recur in the future.\n",
      "(d) Cost Optimization Program charges includes severance and facilities charges incurred in connection with the program initiated in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(e) Geographic repositioning includes expenses associated with the relocation to other countries of employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, and includes the cost of accommodations, travel and food. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(f) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia, the Company incurred impairment charges for long-lived assets in Russia including charges of $15.1 million associated with property and equipment, $3.8 million associated with right-of-use assets and $0.7 million associated with goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, impairment charges have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(g) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia and the process of completing a phased exit of its operations in Russia, the Company incurred charges associated with employee separation. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, employee separation costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(h) On July 26, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its remaining operations in Russia and recorded a loss on sale of approximately $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, including the recognition of the accumulated currency translation loss related to this foreign entity that was previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the financial statements. The Company excluded this loss from non-GAAP results as it is one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(i) One-time benefit related to the implementation of tax planning to disregard certain foreign subsidiaries as separate entities for U.S. income tax purposes. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, the benefit related to the implementation of tax planning has been excluded from non-GAAP results as it is one-time and unusual in nature.\n",

      "Given the current market conditions of EPAM, a Reversal Trading strategy's risk assessment should consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Revenue Decline**: The consistent decline in revenue could indicate ongoing market challenges or operational inefficiencies.\n",
      "2. **Cost Management**: The Cost Optimization Program and associated costs might affect short-term profitability but aim to enhance long-term sustainability.\n",

      "- **Operational Changes**: Continuous cost optimization and restructuring efforts might result in short-term disruptions or negative market perceptions.\n",
      "- **Geopolitical Factors**: The exit from Russia and geopolitical instability in regions of operation pose significant risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- **Diversification**: Consider diversifying trades to mitigate the risk of revenue and EPS volatility.\n",
      "- **Close Monitoring**: Regularly monitor market conditions and adjust strategies to align with current performance metrics and forecasts.\n",
      "- **Risk Management**: Implement robust risk management practices to protect against unforeseen market or operational disruptions.\n",

      "Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n",
      "EPAM supplements results reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in EPAM's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and externally, for managing EPAM's business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures help investors compare EPAM's operating performance with its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will continue to report both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non-GAAP results that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM's humanitarian commitment to its professionals in Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, costs associated with the geographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs incurred in connection with a restructuring program including the Company's exit from Russia, certain other one-time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" and an \"organic constant currency basis,\" which are also non-GAAP financial measures. These measures exclude the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. In addition, revenues on an \"organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia\" reflect the decision to exit from Russia by removing revenues from customers located in Russia in both the current period and prior period of comparison. Because EPAM's reported non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non-GAAP measures reported by other companies within EPAM's industry. Consequently, EPAM's non-GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in EPAM's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n",

Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our business and operations. These statements may include words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or similar expressions. Those future events and trends may relate to, among other things, developments relating to the war in Ukraine and escalation of the war in the surrounding region, political and civil unrest or military action in the geographies where we conduct business and operate, difficult conditions in global capital markets, foreign exchange markets and the broader economy, and the effect that these events may have on customer demand and our revenues, operations, access to capital, and profitability. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the risk factors discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the factors discussed in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, particularly under the headings \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Risk Factors\" and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties and are made based on information currently available to us. EPAM undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.\n",

      "(a) Humanitarian support in Ukraine includes expenses related to EPAM's $100 million humanitarian commitment in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine to support EPAM professionals and their families in and displaced from Ukraine. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(b) Given the uncertainty in the region introduced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, EPAM has assigned delivery professionals in locations outside of the region to ensure the continuity of delivery for customers who have substantial delivery exposure to Ukraine or other delivery concerns resulting from the invasion. These employees are not billed to clients and operate largely in a standby or backup capacity. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(c) Discretionary compensation includes the reduction of previously accrued amounts associated with the Company's variable compensation program for the year ended December 31, 2021. This adjustment was made in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is not expected to recur in the future.\n",
      "(d) Cost Optimization Program charges includes severance and facilities charges incurred in connection with the program initiated in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(e) Geographic repositioning includes expenses associated with the relocation to other countries of employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, and includes the cost of accommodations, travel and food. These expenses are incremental to those expenses incurred prior to the crisis, clearly separable from normal operations, and not expected to recur once the crisis has subsided and operations return to normal.\n",
      "(f) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia, the Company incurred impairment charges for long-lived assets in Russia including charges of $15.1 million associated with property and equipment, $3.8 million associated with right-of-use assets and $0.7 million associated with goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, impairment charges have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(g) As a result of the Company's decision to no longer serve customers in Russia and the process of completing a phased exit of its operations in Russia, the Company incurred charges associated with employee separation. Consistent with the Company's historical non-GAAP policy, employee separation costs incurred in connection with formal restructuring initiatives have been excluded from non-GAAP results as these are one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
      "(h) On July 26, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its remaining operations in Russia and recorded a loss on sale of approximately $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, including the recognition of the accumulated currency translation loss related to this foreign entity that was previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the financial statements. The Company excluded this loss from non-GAAP results as it is one-time and unusual in nature.\n",
