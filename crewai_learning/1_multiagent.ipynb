    "Maxim's remarks regarding the class. It is very synthetic and poorly depicts the concept. What this example does is generating an answeer based on a single tech doc, it can not be generalized to other tasks.  And after ytou spend this much time following the class and recreating the chain of agents, troubleshooting the AzureOpenAI embeddings (to use memory=True flag which is by the way not used) you end up questrioning yourself wouldn't it be easier for  you just to use OpenAI chat completions and have it execute a prompt with user inquery and copy-pasting web site text."
