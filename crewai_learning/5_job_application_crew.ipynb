Autonomy is vital, demanding advanced AI, machine learning, and decision-making algorithms. Resilience, fault tolerance, and contingency protocols are essential for managing risks and failures. Engineers must consider radiation-hardened components and shielding techniques due to space's high radiation levels. Quality and reliability assurance, including rigorous testing, traceability, and continuous process improvement, ensures mission success despite the inherent challenges.\n",

Max was also great to have as part of our management group when traveling to meet clients and prospects at their place of business. His problem-solving skills were an asset at those meetings as he is quick-thinking and nimble, which our customers found extremely helpful. He is also quite humble, patient and just an all-around solid person. While Max will be missed at ScienceSoft, I support his career growth and strongly recommend him for future opportunities. ”\n",
